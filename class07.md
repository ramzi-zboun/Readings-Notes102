## Objects


**Built-in Objects**

The first thing you need to do is get to know what tools are available.
You can imagine that your new toolkit has three compartments:

*Object constructors can use a function as a template for creating objects.*

1- create the template with the object's properties and methods.

function object name (prop1, prop2, prop3) {
th i s . prop1 = prop1 ;
th is.  prop2 =  prop2; 
this prop3 = prop3;

}

2- call it using anew keyword

WHAT DOES THIS SECTION COVER?
**purpose of this section Cover** is
