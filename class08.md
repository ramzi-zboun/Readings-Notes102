|Layout|Description|
|---|---|
|z-index|Its value is a number, and the higher the number the closer this element is to the front. For example, an item with a z-index of 10 will appear above an item with a z-index of five.|
|position:static| You can see how it extends the width of the entire browser window by default..|
|Layout Grids|Grids set consistent proportions and spaces between items which helps to create a professional looking design,Many designers use a grid structure to help them position items on a page, and the same is true for web designers. |
|position:relative|Moves an element in relation to where it would have been in normal flow|
|position:fixed|It positions the element in relation to the browser window. Therefore, when a user scrolls down the page, it stays in the exact same place. It is a good idea to try this example in your browser to see the effect.|
|float|It allows you to take an element in the natural flow and place it as far as possible to the left or right of the containing element.|
