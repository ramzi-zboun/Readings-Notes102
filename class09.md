# Forms and JS Events
## Chapter 7: Forms
## Forms
An HTML form is used to collect user input. The user input is most often sent to a server for processing.

  
- When you want to collect information from visitors, you will need a form contained within the <form> element.
- Each form control is given a name, and the text the user types in or the values of the options they select are sent to the server.
- HTML5 introduces new form elements that make it easy for visitors to fill in forms.
- Information from a form is sent in value and names pairs.

  ## LISTS , TABLES AND FORMS
  
1. In addition to the CSS properties covered in other chapters which work with the contents of all elements, there are several others that are specifically used to control the appearance of lists, tables, and forms.
2. Forms benefit from styles that make them feel more interactive.
4. List markers can be given different appearances using the list-style-type and list-style image properties.
5. Forms are easier to use if the form controls are vertically aligned using CSS.
6. Table cells can have different borders and spacing in different browsers, but there are properties you can use to control them and make them more consistent.

## The3 Events in JS

- *Binding is the process of stating which event you are waiting to happen, and which element you are waiting for that event to happen upon.*
  - *When an event occurs on an element, it can trigger a JS function. When this function then changes the web page in some way, it feels interactive because it has responded to the user.*
 - *use events to monitor events that happen on all of the element.*
- *The most commonly used events are W3C DOM events, although there are others in the HTMLS specification as well as browser-specific events.*
